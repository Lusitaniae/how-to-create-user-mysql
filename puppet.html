            <p>Create a user with SELECT and UPDATE permissions</p>
          	<code>
mysql::db { 'mydb':
  user     => 'myuser',
  password => 'mypass',
  host     => 'localhost',
  grant    => ['SELECT', 'UPDATE'],
}
            	</code>
                <p>Create a user with a pre hashed password and the same SELECT and UPDATE permissions</p>
          	<code>
mysql::db { 'mydb':
  user     => 'myuser',
  password => '*6C8989366EAF75BB670AD8EA7A7FC1176A95CEF4',
  host     => 'localhost',
  grant    => ['SELECT', 'UPDATE'],
}
